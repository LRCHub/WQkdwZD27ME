[00:04.80] Gone a little far
[00:07.19] Gone a little far this time with something
[00:14.63] How was I to know?
[00:17.01] How was I to know this high came rushing?
[00:24.19] We're on the borderline
[00:26.84] Dangerously fine and unforgiven
[00:34.02] Possibly a sign
[00:36.42] I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
[00:45.71] Here I go
[00:48.36] Quite a show for a loner in L.A.​
[00:53.43] I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
[01:00.59] Where I couldn't get away
[01:03.52] We're on the borderline (Ooh)
[01:06.21] Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
[01:13.11] Then I saw the time
[01:15.77] Watched it speedin' by like a train
[01:20.06] Like a train
[01:29.89] Will I be known and loved?
[01:32.28] Is there one that I trust?
[01:34.69] Starting to sober up
[01:37.10] Has it been long enough?
[01:39.49] Will I be known and loved?
[01:42.14] Little closer, close enough
[01:44.54] I'm a loser, loosen up
[01:46.93] Setting free, must be tough
[01:49.10] Will I be known and loved?
[01:52.02] Is there one that I trust?
[01:54.43] Starting to sober up
[01:56.82] Has it been long enough?
[01:59.21] Will I be so in love?
[02:01.60] Any closer? Close enough
[02:04.28] Shout out to what is done
[02:06.95] R.I.P., here comes the sun
[02:17.57] (Comes the sun)
[02:19.44] Gone a little far
[02:21.86] Gone a little far this time with something
[02:29.26] Rudi said it's fine
[02:31.66] They used to do this all the time in college (If you and I get comfortable)
[02:38.59] And we're on the borderline (Ooh)
[02:41.33] Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
[02:48.54] Then I saw the time
[02:51.20] Watched it speedin' by like a train
[02:56.54] Will I be known and loved?
[02:57.89] Is there one that I trust?
[03:00.31] Starting to sober up
[03:02.97] Has it been long enough?
[03:05.12] Will I be known and loved?
[03:07.56] Little closer, close enough
[03:09.99] I'm a loser, loosen up
[03:12.68] Setting free, must be tough
[03:15.07] Will I be known and loved?
[03:17.46] Is there one that I trust?
[03:20.13] Starting to sober up
[03:22.52] Has it been long enough?
[03:24.92] Will I be so in love?
[03:27.58] Any closer? Close enough
[03:29.71] Shout out to what is done
[03:32.14] R.I.P., here comes the sun
[03:43.37] (Comes the sun)
