Let¥s ride the Greenbeast that lives nowhere
It¥s cold and fast enough to take our souls away

Borderline in shadow, the moon is reflected by machines

They¥ll be mad about that attractive shape
They¥ll never forget that attractive touch

Borderline in shadow, he gets the power from mercy

In you, raising the flag in your right hand, begging a kiss from girls
Parade keeps going on and on
While your mother washes your shoes
You find yourself a killer
Keep going without fear
They will never wipe your tear

Tick tock tick, we¥ve spent times in cold vain
Rifles knock down the Beast standing in cold rain

Borderline in shadow, his eyes were lighting emptiness

In you, armed with a gun in your left hand, begging a kiss from god
Parade is going on and on
I just want you to be near
Tears fall into beer
You find yourself a killer
You can¥t see yourself in the mirror
Everything has dissapeared
You find yourself a killer
Keep going without fear

Shall we go somewhere better than this place
You are the master Greenbeast
Drinking wine, we sing aloud for the joy to the world

They¥ll be mad about that attractive shape
They¥ll never forget that attractive touch

Following pioneers
Facing sky¥s surface
Shooting the eyes apeared
I found myself a killer
I can¥t see myself clear
I just want you to be neer
Everything has dissapeared
Beautiful handred years
Beautiful handred years
Beautiful handred years
