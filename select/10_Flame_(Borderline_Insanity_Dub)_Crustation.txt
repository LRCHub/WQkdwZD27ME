Bruised she feels
Insecure and jilted
Like a thief he tried to steel her soul
Slyer than his easy smile
He tried to use her for a while
Underneath she's empty as a whole

Oh flame's still burning
She's not learning
Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

Loaded with ammunition
Coded by her ambition
He fires a sweet talk into defenseless she
Shot and numb with poison words
She struggles uselessly
Unhurt a slave to his cruel captivity

Oh flame's still burning
She's not learning
Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

It's all a game
For him to play
He trank a deep
And threw her away
Deluding her
No illusion is numb

Cynicism neared his head
And left his appetite
Unfed
Alone all his brilliant words
Are dead

Oh flame's still burning
She's not learning
Can't keep turning
Back discarded memories
Dusty thoughts
Start to tease her

He turned her world to black
But she's stopped looking back
Tattooed it all in black
Discretion is the key
To his reality
And she feels now she's free
So she chooses then and there
To leave without a care
She goes into the dusk
As easy as a breeze
No longer on her knees
Her soul is now at peace
