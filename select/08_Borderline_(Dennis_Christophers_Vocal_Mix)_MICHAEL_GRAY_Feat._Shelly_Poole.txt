It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
'Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline

All I know is I've been sitting
With this fire and it burns inside
Man if you want me to walk your line
Then don't stop at eight, no let's take it

To the nine's
I know that we should lay out and love
Because man, I really need it

To the nine's
I may be full but it's not enough
Come and show me how to feel it

It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
'Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline

All or nothing, you know that's how I play
The game and I'm ready now
Man if you want me, come cross the line and
Slide up to eight, then let's take it

To the nine's
I know that we should lay out and love
Because man, I really need it

To the nine's
I may be full but it's not enough
Come and show me how to feel it

It's gonna be another lonely night
One more and I'm gonna die
Wired out waiting for the sign
'Cause you're a risk and I'm borderline
